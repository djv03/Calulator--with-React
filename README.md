# Calulator--with-React
Classic calculator but made with react concepts like useStatenhooks and state managnement.

This app is part of my course "React-by meta devlopers"
this is the final project submission for the basic level of React and we are going to learn some advanced concepts of react

It was fun to learn react from creators of React itself

I hope you like it

HAPPY CODING!!!
