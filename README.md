# Calulator--with-React
Classic calculator but made with react concepts like useStatenhooks and state managnement.

This app is part of my course "React-by meta devlopers"
this is the final project submission for the basic level of React and we are going to learn some advanced concepts of react

YOU NEED TO DO npm install before initialising it to run it
It was fun to learn react from creators of React itself

I hope you like it

HAPPY CODING!!!
